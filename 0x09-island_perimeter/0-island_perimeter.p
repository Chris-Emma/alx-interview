""" Module with island_perimeter function that returns the perimeter
of an island described in grid.
grid will be list of integers.
0 represents water and 1 represents land.
Each cell is a square with side length 1. And are connected
horizontally/vertically.
Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island.
No lakes (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island).
